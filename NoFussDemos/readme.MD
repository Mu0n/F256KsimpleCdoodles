## No Fuss Demos ##

Simple tech demos that require little knowledge to run

### Special note on the mp3 playback demos ###

Make sure you get the mp3 file corresponding mp3 to the demo program, let both program and mp3 file sit in the same folder (probably root folder for simplicity)

mp3-RJ.pgz needs ronald.mp3 

mp3-SC.pgz needs terranone.mp3

### Special note the f/manager apps ###

midiplayer.pgz can be used standalone with /- midiplayer filename.mid  
F256amp.pgz can be used standalone with /- F256amp filename.mp3 (will be added to f/manager soon. rename to generic F256amp name by dropping the version number from the name)

or it can be put in folder _apps in your root folder and be used in conjunction with f/manager from Micah, which is a file browser program with copy, rename, viewing, etc. You can find it in the software page of the wiki. [https://wiki.f256foenix.com/index.php?title=Software]
