## No Fuss Demos ##

Simple tech demos that require little knowledge to run

### Special note on some mp3 playback demos ###

Make sure you get the mp3 file corresponding mp3 to the demo program, let both program and mp3 file sit in the same folder (probably root folder for simplicity)

mp3-RJ.pgz needs ronald.mp3 

mp3-SC.pgz needs terranone.mp3

### Special note the some audio playing apps ###

midiplayer.pgz can be used standalone with /- midiplayer filename.mid  
F256amp.pgz can be used standalone with /- F256amp filename.mp3 (feel free to rename it to a generic 'F256amp.pgz' name by dropping the version number)

### Integrating some of these with Micah's f/manager ###

f/manager is from Micah, and is a file browser program with copy, rename, viewing, etc. You can find it in the software page of the wiki. [https://wiki.f256foenix.com/index.php?title=Software]

Put these programs in your root level /_apps/ folder with this naming scheme:

F256amp.pgz -> audioplayer.pgz
midiplayer.pgz -> midiplayer.pgz

And you can now happily browse files inside f/manager and directly launch their playback by pressing enter on some audio files (mp3, wav, ogg, wma, mid, etc).
