This is a utility that can convert a standard midi file in .mid format and      
create a corresponding .dim file with the same file name prefix, in the same    
directory as the original file. The .dim files are simplified for quick loading.
This program's working directory is in your root's /midi/ folder.               
                                                                                
Usage- navigate to the file you want and press one of the following keys:       
                                                                                
Enter: Loads the .mid, analyzes it and saves a .dim                             
                                                                                
Shift-Enter: Loads the corresponding .dim file (if it exists) and plays it.     
                                                                                
Space: plays whatever is loaded into memory from previous Enter or shift-enter
